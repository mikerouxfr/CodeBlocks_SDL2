# CodeBlocks_SDL2
This repository purpose ~~was~~ is only to share **a** sample project\
\- openable with the [**Code::Block**](http://codeblocks.org) IDE ;\
\- and including the [**SDL**](https://www.libsdl.org) graphic (and more) library.

As I initially worked on that during winter of 2014, I don't remember which SDL version is it exactly.

Of course there are other solutions to make it work\
but that was the best solution I got for the year final project exam.

Feel free to contact me if you have any question with this.
